# Run 01_create_CHELSA_links.R yourself, either on EVE or locally (and transfer file) 
# You can then use the lines below any time you need to extract information, as long as you have the CHELSA files still downloaded

# ALWAYS look at the 02 log files. Any corrupted files will be printed there, but the extraction (should) keeps going.
#If any fail, you will have to redownload those.

# 03 waits until 02 is finished with OK status. IF 02 failes, 03 will never start and you need to remove it completely. 
# I'm pretty sure 03 will also start if there are corrupted files in 02 as 02 should keep going if it encounters corrupted files

#R scripts start with comments on what needs to be changed for other situations
#Submission below of #03 requires additional arguments. See .sh file for details
